  noteTitle: Reflecting on the ISP Model
  noteContentArray:
  - One specific information behaviour is information seeking. Information seeking
    is a conscious effort to acquire information in response to a need or gap in your
    knowledge. Simplistically, we seek for information when we need knowledge about
    something.
  - 'Information seeking involves a series of encounters with information within a
    period of time, rather than a one-off reference encounter. It can also be viewed
    as a process of sensemaking in which a person is forming a personal point of view.  '
  - "Information seeking is a constructive activity during which you actively find
    meaning which fits in with what you already knew. This is what makes it deeply
    personal \u2013 the act of making sense within your frame of reference to arrive
    at meaning imbued with your biases, idiosyncrasies, logic and philosophy. "
  - 'In sensemaking, information from various sources is assimilated into what is
    already known through a series of choices. You need to decide what is useful,
    and what is not; what makes sense, and what does not; and how to combine and blend
    information in a unique way. '
  - 'Information seeking culminates in new understanding or solution. Evidence of
    the transformation of information into meaning can be seen in the products generated
    or presentations delivered. '
  - 'The active process of building a view of the world is your task in the ISP Model.
    An information search is a process of construction which involves your whole experience,
    feelings as well as thoughts and actions. '
