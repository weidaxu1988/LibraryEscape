  noteTitle: Pearl Growing
  noteContentArray:
  - "You are ready to apply the technique of \u201Cpearl growing\u201D when you have
    discovered one or a few pearls, articles which are especially relevant for your
    assignments."
  - There are a few ways of growing your pearl. The first way is based on the fact
    that articles on the same topic are assigned the same keywords. So look for the
    keywords assigned to your pearls and perform your search again based on those
    keywords.
  - "The second way to grow your pearl is based on the fact that the scholars usually
    work on an area of research and typically publish several articles in the same
    area. To apply this, search for other articles that the authors of the pearls
    that you\u2019ve uncovered have written."
  - "If they have written many articles, a good idea is to restrict the dates to \xB15
    years of the pearl you\u2019ve uncovered. Authors usually write in the same area
    within a span of time, and a ten year window is a good span to start with."
  - The third way of growing your pearl is to look for the articles that have been
    cited by your pearls. Authors cite articles that are relevant to the article they
    are writing, and looking through the reference list is a good idea for obtaining
    more pearls for you.
  - The final way of growing your pearl is to look for the articles that have cited
    your pearls. This is especially useful if your pearl is dated, and you want articles
    that are more recent.
