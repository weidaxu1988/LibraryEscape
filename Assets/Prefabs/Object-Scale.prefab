  noteTitle: ACRL Information Literacy Standards
  noteContentArray:
  - The most widely-known IL standard is the one developed by the American Association
    of College and Research Libraries (ACRL). The ACRL standards identify six things
    that an information literate person is able to do.
  - 'To determine the amount of information needed.  This ability is important because
    with the abundance of inforamtion on the Internet, a person can search unendingly.
    An information literate person knows when he has enough for the task he is trying
    to complete. '
  - "To access the needed information effectively and efficiently  You have to decide
    what to use \u2013 a monograph, an article published in a journal or presented
    at a conference, or an entry in an encyclopedia. "
  - "To evaluate information and its sources critically  This applies especially to
    information obtained from the Intenet because anyone can publish on the Internet,
    and much there is also much information published \u201Canonymously\u201D. You
    are able to look out for clues that enable you to tell good information from bad,
    up-to-date information from obsolete. Even journals vary in their quality and
    authority. "
  - "To incorporate selected information into one\u2019s knowledge base  From the
    information you have located and evaluated, you have to decide which is most relevant
    to the task you are trying to complete. Having done that, you have to link the
    information to what you already know, and to fill up existing knowledge gaps. "
  - 'To use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose  You need to
    be able to taylor the information found differently according to whether he is
    preparing for a report or term paper, a presentation, or a lesson plan. '
  - 'To understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information,
    and access and use information ethically and legally  You need to understand the
    ethical issues that arise in the use of specific types of information, e.g., research
    data. You also have to understand issues like plagiarism, and the importance of
    citing articles properly. '
